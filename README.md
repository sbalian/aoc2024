# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

My solutions to [AOC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) in Python.

The project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To start a new day:

```bash
uv run good_morning.py
```

To run the solutions for a particular day:

```bash
cd solutions/day01 && uv run solution.py && cd ../..
```

To run all the solutions:

```bash
uv run merry_christmas.py
```
